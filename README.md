# DICOM HealthImaging POC

## Project Overview

This is a Proof of Concept (POC) project that demonstrates the integration of a Single Page Application (SPA) with AWS HealthImaging service. The project aims to validate the feasibility of building a medical imaging solution that can interact with DICOM datastores in AWS.

## Objectives

The primary goals of this POC are to:

1. **Search Functionality**: Confirm the ability to search a DICOM datastore for medical images using metadata criteria
2. **Image Viewing**: Demonstrate the capability to retrieve and display DICOM files in a web-based user interface
3. **AWS Integration**: Validate the integration patterns between a web application and AWS HealthImaging services

## Key Features

- Search DICOM studies and series by metadata (patient ID, study date, modality, etc.)
- Retrieve and display medical images in a web browser
- Demonstrate secure access to AWS HealthImaging resources
- Provide a foundation for future medical imaging application development

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Single Page Application (SPA)
- **Backend**: AWS HealthImaging
- **Cloud Platform**: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Image Format**: DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)

## Use Cases

This POC addresses common medical imaging workflows:
- Radiologists searching for patient studies
- Viewing medical images for diagnostic purposes
- Integrating medical imaging into healthcare applications

## Project Status

This is a proof of concept project intended to validate technical feasibility and integration patterns with AWS HealthImaging.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with HealthImaging service access
- DICOM test data imported into AWS HealthImaging datastore
- Appropriate AWS IAM permissions for HealthImaging operations

## Getting Started

_Instructions for setup and deployment will be added as the project develops._

## License

_License information to be determined._
