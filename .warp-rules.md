# Warp AI Development Rules

This file contains development guidelines and rules for Warp AI to follow when working on this project.

## Code Quality & Architecture

### DRY & SOLID Principles

- **Always keep refactoring options to follow DRY & SOLID principles in mind**
- Identify and eliminate code duplication
- Ensure single responsibility for functions and classes
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep interfaces segregated and focused
- Follow dependency inversion principles

### Code Structure

- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes)
- Keep functions small and focused (max 20-30 lines)
- Use meaningful variable and function names that describe their purpose
- Organize code into logical modules and directories
- Follow established project patterns and conventions

## Security Posture

### Security First

- **Always ensure projects' security posture**
- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or sensitive data
- Use environment variables for all configuration
- Validate all input data and sanitize outputs
- Follow least privilege principle for permissions
- Keep dependencies updated and audit for vulnerabilities

### AWS Security

- Use IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- Enable encryption in transit and at rest
- Never commit AWS credentials to version control
- Use secure connection protocols (HTTPS, TLS)
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

## Infrastructure & DevOps

### Terraform Best Practices

- Use consistent resource naming conventions
- Tag all resources appropriately
- Use data sources instead of hardcoded values where possible
- Implement proper state management and backend configuration
- Use variables for reusable values
- Include comprehensive output values

### Docker & Containerization

- Use official base images when possible
- Run containers as non-root users
- Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size
- Include health checks in Dockerfiles
- Pin specific versions of dependencies

## Development Workflow

### Git & Version Control

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use conventional commit format when appropriate
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Create meaningful branch names
- Update documentation with code changes

### Testing & Quality Assurance

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Include error handling and edge cases
- Test with both valid and invalid inputs
- Validate API responses and error codes
- Consider integration testing for critical paths

### Documentation

- Update README files when functionality changes
- Include API documentation for endpoints
- Document environment variables and configuration
- Provide clear setup and deployment instructions
- Include troubleshooting guides

## API & Backend Development

### Express.js Best Practices

- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement request validation and sanitization
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Handle errors gracefully with proper error responses
- Implement rate limiting and security headers

### Error Handling

- Always handle async/await errors properly
- Provide meaningful error messages to clients
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Don't expose internal errors in API responses
- Use structured logging formats

## Frontend Development (Future)

### React/SPA Best Practices

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper state management
- Handle loading and error states
- Optimize for performance and accessibility
- Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA labels

## Performance & Monitoring

### Optimization

- Monitor and optimize database queries
- Implement caching strategies where appropriate
- Use compression for static assets
- Optimize Docker images for size and build time
- Consider lazy loading for non-critical resources

### Monitoring & Observability

- Include health check endpoints
- Log important application events
- Monitor resource usage and performance metrics
- Implement alerting for critical failures
- Use structured logging for better analysis

## Compliance & Standards

### HIPAA/Healthcare Considerations

- Ensure PHI (Protected Health Information) is handled securely
- Implement audit logging for data access
- Use encryption for sensitive medical data
- Follow data retention and disposal policies
- Implement proper access controls

### General Compliance

- Follow industry security standards
- Implement data validation and sanitization
- Use secure communication protocols
- Maintain proper access controls and authentication
- Document security and compliance measures

## Project-Specific Rules

### DICOM HealthImaging POC

- Always include mock/development mode for testing without AWS
- Validate DICOM metadata fields properly
- Handle large medical image files efficiently
- Implement proper error handling for AWS SDK operations
- Consider medical imaging viewing performance requirements

## Communication & Collaboration

### Code Reviews & Feedback

- Provide constructive feedback on code structure
- Suggest improvements for maintainability
- Point out potential security or performance issues
- Recommend best practices and patterns
- Be specific about suggested changes

### Documentation & Explanations

- Explain complex technical decisions
- Provide context for architectural choices
- Include examples in documentation
- Use clear, concise language
- Update documentation alongside code changes
